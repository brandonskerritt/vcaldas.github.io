Hi! I'm Victor Caldas, a brazillian researcher living below the sea level!
I received my PhD from the University of Groningen, in 2016, working on mechanisms of DNA replication and repair using single-molecule fluorescence microscoy. I am currently a postdoc at at the VrijeUniversiteit Amsterdam ([Toby Kiers](http://tobykiers.com)) and at the [AMOLF](amolf.nl) ([Tom Shimizu](https://amolf.nl/people/tom-shimizu)).


I also enjoy [photography](https://500px.com/victorcaldas), scale modelling, 3D printing and support open-source initiatives.

Take a look on the website of the [DIY Bio Groningen](http://www.diybiogroningen.org/) group!

More information to be added.
